      Repository from which to install. May be one of the following:
      distro (default), ppa:somecustom/ppa, a deb url sources entry,

      NOTE: updating this setting to a source that is known to provide
      a later version of OpenStack will trigger a software upgrade unless
      action-managed-upgrade is set to True.

    default: False
    description: |
      If True enables openstack upgrades for this charm via juju actions.
      You will still need to set openstack-origin to the new repository but
      instead of an upgrade running automatically across all units, it will
      wait for you to execute the openstack-upgrade action for this charm on
      each unit. If False it will revert to existing behavior of upgrading
      all units on config change.

      Ports provided can be the name or MAC address of the interface to be
      added to the bridge. If MAC addresses are used, you may provide multiple
      bridge:mac for the same bridge so as to be able to configure multiple
